# Cleanup performed by ChatGPT

I removed generated and dependency directories to make the repository smaller for inspection:
- node_modules/ (removed)
- .next/ (removed)

What I could not do in this environment:
- I could not run `npm install` or `next build` because Node.js is not available here.
- I could not run the app to catch runtime errors.

Suggested next steps you can run locally:
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. From project root:
   - `npm ci` or `npm install`
   - `npm run dev` to start development server
   - `npm run build` then `npm run start` to test production build
3. If errors occur, paste the terminal output here and I'll fix the code.
